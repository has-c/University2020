```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(xgboost)
library(tidyverse)
```

# YRBS 

Pre-question stuff goes here.

## Load in the data

```{r Load in data}
set.seed(369) 
load("yrbs.rda")

#remove observations where labels are NA
missing_labels = is.na(r)
features = x[!missing_labels, ]
labels = r[!missing_labels]
```

## Question 1 
Build a classifier to predict labels r from x with xgboost, and show the confusion matrix

```{r XGBOOST Q1}

```

## Question 2 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
