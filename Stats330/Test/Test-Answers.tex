For the 24 hour duration of this test, I confirm that I will not discuss
the content of the test with anyone else. I will not give any assistance
to another student taking this test. I will not receive any assistance
from any person or tutoring service.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \(log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times age_i + \beta_2 \times (age)^2 + \beta_3 \times smoke.Yes_i + log(years_i)\)
  \(Y_i \sim Poisson(\mu_i)\)
\end{enumerate}

Where \(smoke.Yes_i = !1\) of the ith doctor replied Yes he/she smokes
and \(0\) if the ith doctor replied he/she does not smoke and \(age_i\)
is the mid-point of a given age group in years. \(Y_i\) is the number of
deaths in the ith age group.

Yi is follows a poisson dist with the mean of mu\_i

Talk about log years

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item
  \(logit(p_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times age_i + \beta_2 \times (age)^2 + \beta_3 \times smoke.Yes_i\)
  \(Y_i \sim Binomial(n_i, p_i)\)
\end{enumerate}

\(smoke.Yes_i = !1\) of the ith doctor replied Yes he/she smokes and
\(0\) if the ith doctor replied he/she does not smoke and \(age_i\) is
the mid-point of a given age group in years.

Yi follows binomial dist with ni and pi

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  In \(poisson.fit\) the variable \(years\) is being used as an offset.
  This is because we know the effect of years on the response variable,
  deaths. Generally as someone gets older, their chance of dying
  increases. This effect is displayed as years decreases the number of
  deaths increases. We know the effect of years on deaths and therefore
  do not need to estimate it and it can be used as an offset. The offset
  is incorporated into the model by fitting the log of years.
\end{enumerate}

Known relationship between two variables

\hypertarget{question-3}{%
\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \(logit(p_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times weight_i + \beta_2 \times weight_i + \beta_3 \times sex.male_i\)
  \(Y_i \sim Binomial(n_i, p_i)\)
\end{enumerate}

where \(sex.male_i = 1\) if the insect is a male and \(0\) if the insect
is a female. Moreover, \(age_i\) is the age in years of the ith insect
and \(weight_i\) is the weight in grams of the ith insect.

Yi follows binomial dist with

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  We have evidence (\(p-value \approx 0.02\)) to suggest that the sex of
  an insect had an effect on whether or not it became infected. We
  estimate that the odds of insects that are male becoming infected is
  21.6\% to 94.9\% less than insects that are female, for the same age
  and weight.
\item
  I agree with her decision to fit age with a quadratic effect but not
  weight. This is because looking at the GAM plot and using the rule of
  thumb; consider whether or not it is possible to to fit a straight
  line between the dashed lines on the GAM plot. If you cannot fit a
  straight line then consider fitting higher order polynomials. Looking
  at the GAM plot for weight a straight line can be fit and therefore it
  was sensible not to fit a quadratic term for weight at this stage. In
  comparision, looking at the GAM plot for age it can be observed that a
  straight line cannot be fit between the dashed GAM lines. Thus, a
  quadratic term was fitted for age.
\end{enumerate}

Talk about why quadratic - one hump

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  I would recommend \(insects.quad\) over \(insects1.fit\). This is
  because even though both models are appropriate (Pearson, deviance and
  randomised quantile residual plots are patternless bands around 0) and
  good fits (from the deviance we evidence suggesting the models are
  good fits to the dataset) the quadratic term in \(insects.quad\) is
  significant (at a 5\% level) and cannot be ignored. This implies a
  non-linear relationship between the response and age which is captured
  by \(insects.quad\). Furthermore, the deviance of \(insects.quad\) is
  lower than \(insects1.fit\) implying it is a better fit.
\item
  The null hypothesis being tested is that there is no interaction
  between the any of the explanatory variables.
\item
  We have no evidence (p-value \approx 0.39) to suggest that there any
  interactions between age, weight and sex.
